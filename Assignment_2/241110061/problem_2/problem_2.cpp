/*<pthread mutex t enter>
In case of shared buffer size < number of lines read by each thread, this mutex allows
each thread to atomically write his share in the shared buffer, without interference
from other producer threads. But consumer threads can compete for access to the
shared buffer.

>pthread mutex t mutex2
This mutex allows each thread to read content from the file(in my case I have reduced
I/O to only 1 time, by writing the content of file in one shared memory buffer). It
synchronizes the threads to read the content, without any race conditions. Also when
one thread is writing its content in a shared buffer, this mutex allows other threads
to store the content of the file(self-created buffer) in their local buffer parallelly with
other threads that is writing content in the shared buffer.

>pthread mutex t mutex
This mutex is used between the consumer thread and the producer thread. This
is used to synchronize these 2 threads to access the shared buffer, from where the
consumer will read content and write in a file, whereas the producer thread will write
the content of his local buffer in the shared buffer

>pthread barrier t BARRIER
This barrier prevents the threads from running their function unless all threads are
created. So each thread will execute itâ€™s thread function only when all threads are
created.

>pthread cond t shared buffer not empty
This conditional variable is used in the context, of the producer. If the shared buffer
is full, then the producer have to wait until the consumer extracts and removes the
content of the shared buffer. When content of shared buffer is extracted by consumer,
then he will signal the waiting producer to write more content in shared buffer.

>pthread cond t shared buffer not full
Similarly, this conditional variable is used to tell the consumer that the buffer is not
full, and thus if the shared buffer has no data, then the consumer will wait
